          <p>15/02/2021 - Ongoing</p>
          <p>Developer on the Note Taking Express iOS and Android app, data servers and accompanying microservices.</p>
          <p>App is desinged for students to take recordings of lectures, and have the recordings turned into readable notes.</p>
          <p>App is created with technologies such as JavaScript, REACT Native for iOS and Android, NodeJS, Typescript. Data servers and microservices developed used PSQL, Javascript, Docker, Amazon Web Services.</p>
          <p>It has been challenging but fun getting to grips with these previously new technologies. Seeing how the app has progressed and evolved thanks to features I've developed for it has been a rewarding and developmental experience, and the promise of being onboarded to other projects is motivation enough to keep doing my best with it.</p>
          <p>The mobile app will be available for download in the UK soon, but in the meantime the NTEHub webportal and more can be found <a href='https://ntehub.com'>here</a></p>

          <p>Developer on the PONToon project for Portsmouth Council with the University.</p>
          <p>This app is designed to allow recruiters to pin their training centres and community events, and to allow job/training-seeking users to find such pins.</p>
          <p>The app was created from the ground up. It is a fun project to be a part of and has greatly developed my skills.</p>
          <p>This app was created using Javascript, HTML5, CSS, NodeJS, Google APIs and in-house APIs.</p>
          <p>This project is still in development and can be found <a href='https://pontoonapps.com/community-web/'>here</a></p>

          <p>September 2016 - Ongoing</p>
          <p>Being a software student at two universities has allowed me to work on multiple projects for coursework.</p>
          <p>They have allowed me experience in developing web applications, scripting in Unity, Agile development practices, UX design and more.</p>
          <p>Doing so developed my foundational skills for local and web app development. I have improved since my earlier work, and through ongoing projects I'm improving further.</p>
          <p>You can find some of these projects on my <a href='https://github.com/UP938828'>github</a></p>
