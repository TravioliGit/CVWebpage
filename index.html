          <p>Developer on the PONToon project for Portsmouth Council with the University.</p>
          <p>This app is designed to allow recruiters to pin their training centres and community events, and to allow job/training-seeking users to find such pins.</p>
          <p>The app was created from the ground up. It is a fun project to be a part of and has greatly developed my skills.</p>
          <p>This project is still in development and can be found <a href='https://pontoonapps.com/community-map-draft/'>here</a></p>

          <p>September 2016 - Ongoing</p>
          <p>Being a software student at two universities has allowed me to work on multiple projects for coursework.</p>
          <p>Doing so developed my foundational skills for local and web app development. I have improved since my earlier work, and through ongoing projects I'm improving further.</p>
          <p>You can find some of these projects on my <a href='https://github.com/UP938828'>github</a></p>
